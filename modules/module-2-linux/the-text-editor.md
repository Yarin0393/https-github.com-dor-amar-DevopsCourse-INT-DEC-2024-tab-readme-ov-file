### **Text Editors in Linux**

---

### **1. Introduction**

In Linux, text editors are essential tools for creating and modifying text files, which are widely used for configurations, scripting, and coding. There are two main categories of text editors:

1. **Command-line-based editors** (e.g., `nano`, `vi`, `vim`).
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based editors** (e.g., `gedit`, `kate`).

This lecture focuses on **command-line text editors**, as they are crucial for server environments where GUIs are often unavailable.

### **4. Hands-On Practice**

### Task 1: Using Nano

1. Open a new file named `example.txt` with Nano:
    
    ```bash
    nano example.txt
    ```

    This is an example using Nano.
    ```
    
3. Save the file:
    - Press `CTRL+O`, then `Enter`.
4. Exit Nano:
    - Press `CTRL+X`.

### Task 2: Using Vim

1. Open the same `example.txt` file with Vim:
    
    ```bash
    vim example.txt
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the end of the file using the arrow keys.
3. Enter insert mode by pressing `i`.
4. Add the line:
    
    ```vbnet
    Adding more text with Vim.
    ```
    
5. Save and quit:
    - Press `ESC` to enter normal mode.
    - Type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

### Task 3: Compare Nano and Vim

1. Open the file again using both editors and note:
    - Ease of navigation.
    - Simplicity vs. features.
