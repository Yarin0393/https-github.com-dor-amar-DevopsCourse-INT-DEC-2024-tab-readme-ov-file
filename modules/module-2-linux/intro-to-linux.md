**If you are here - That means you have an up and running VM! Congratulations!!!**

In this module, weâ€™re going to embark on a journey into Linux, a cornerstone of modern computing and DevOps practices.

### **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that powers everything from personal computers to the worldâ€™s largest servers.

1. **Open Source**:
    - Itâ€™s community-driven, with developers worldwide contributing to its codebase.
    - You can modify, use, and distribute Linux freely.
2. **Widely Used**:
    - Most servers and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) run Linux.
    - Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins are designed to work seamlessly on Linux.
3. **Reliable and Secure**:
    - Known for its stability, Linux rarely crashes.
    - Its robust security features make it the top choice for hosting applications.

### **Why Are We Learning Linux?**

Linux is foundational for DevOps, making it a must-have skill for any engineer.

- **Infrastructure Management**: Almost all servers use Linux as the operating system.
- **DevOps Tools**: Most automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform) require Linux knowledge.
- **Scripting**: Writing scripts in Linux streamlines deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- **Job Readiness**: Proficiency in Linux is a key requirement in the DevOps field.

### **When Will We Use Linux?**

You will use Linux throughout your DevOps career:

- **Setting Up Servers**: From creating cloud-based virtual machines to installing applications.
- **Managing Deployments**: Automating code deployments and managing infrastructure.
- **Troubleshooting**: Debugging issues on live servers or containerized environments.
- **Building CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines often run on Linux.

### **What is the Terminal?**

The terminal is a text-based interface to communicate with the operating system.

- **Think of it as the brain of Linux**: Unlike a graphical user interface (GUI), it allows you to execute commands directly.
- **Why Use It?**
    - Faster than clicking through menus.
    - Provides deeper control over the system.
    - Essential for automation, scripting, and troubleshooting.
- **How It Works**: You type a command, and the operating system executes it, often providing feedback or output.

### **What Makes Linux Unique?**

1. **File-Centric System**:
    - Everything in Linux is a fileâ€”documents, processes, and even hardware devices.
    - This uniformity makes Linux extremely powerful and flexible.
2. **Case Sensitivity**:
    - File and directory names are case-sensitive, so `File.txt` and `file.txt` are different.
3. **Multi-User Environment**:
    - Multiple users can work on the same Linux system without interfering with each other.
4. **Command-Driven**:
    - Mastery of the terminal makes you much more productive.

### **How Do We Interact with Linux?**

1. **The Shell**:
    - A shell is a command-line interpreter that takes commands, processes them, and outputs the result.
    - The most common shell weâ€™ll use is **Bash**.
2. **Commands**:
    - Commands are the building blocks of Linux operations, allowing you to manipulate files, processes, and configurations.
3. **Scripts**:
    - Combining commands into scripts automates repetitive tasks.

**Before We Start with Commands**

Now that you know why Linux is important, where itâ€™s used, and how the terminal works, weâ€™ll dive into basic Linux commands.

These commands will allow you to navigate, create, and manage files and directories, giving you a solid foundation for the more advanced topics ahead.
