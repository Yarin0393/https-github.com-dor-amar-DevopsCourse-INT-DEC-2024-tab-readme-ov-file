# Using an AWS account on this course

### **Using AWS Accounts in This Course**

In this course, we will be working extensively with **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** to gain hands-on experience in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure.

### **AWS Free Tier**

- AWS offers a **Free Tier**, which allows you to use many AWS services for **free** within certain limits for the first 12 months after account creation.
- This is a great opportunity to explore AWS services without incurring high costs.

**Key Details About AWS Free Tier:**

1. **Compute Services (EC2):** 750 hours of a t2.micro instance per month.
2. **Storage Services (S3):** 5GB of standard storage.
3. **Databases (RDS):** 750 hours of a db.t2.micro instance per month.
4. **Other Services:** Services like Lambda, CloudWatch, and DynamoDB are also partially covered under the free tier.

### **How We Will Work With AWS**

1. **Personal AWS Accounts**
    - Each student will use **their own AWS account** for most of the exercises.
    - This is important because working on your own account gives you **hands-on, real-world experience** in managing cloud resources, billing, and monitoring.
    - AWS requires a valid credit card to set up an account. You will only be charged if you exceed Free Tier limits or use paid services.
    
    > Tip: Always monitor your usage via the AWS Billing Dashboard to avoid unexpected charges.
    > 
2. **Using the Course AWS Account**
    - For some specific labs and larger projects, we will provide access to **our course AWS account**.
    - This is useful for exercises that require resources beyond the Free Tier or shared environments.

### **Key Guidelines for AWS Usage**

- **Create a New AWS Account** if you don’t already have one. We will guide you through the setup process.
- **Be Careful with Resources**: Always stop or delete resources (like EC2 instances) after completing labs to avoid unnecessary charges.
- **Billing Awareness**: Keep track of your usage in the AWS Billing Dashboard.
- **Respect Course Account Resources**: When working on the shared course account, follow instructions strictly and clean up resources after use.

### **Why Use Your Own Account?**

- It simulates **real-world scenarios** where you are responsible for managing cloud environments.
- You’ll develop skills like cost management, resource optimization, and security best practices.
- Using AWS responsibly ensures you are prepared for DevOps roles in actual production environments.
