### **1. Introduction to IDEs**

### **What is an IDE?**

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development, all within a single interface.

### **Why Use an IDE?**

- **Convenience:** Combines tools like a text editor, debugger, and compiler.
- **Efficiency:** Increases productivity with features like syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and error detection.
- **Support:** Often tailored for specific programming languages.
- **Debugging:** Built-in tools to test and debug code.

### **Common IDEs:**

- **General-purpose:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode), IntelliJ IDEA, Atom.
- **Language-specific:** PyCharm (Python), Eclipse (Java), Xcode (iOS).

### **What is Visual Studio Code (VSCode)?**

- A lightweight, open-source IDE developed by Microsoft.
- Supports multiple languages, extensions, and integrations.
- Popular among developers for its ease of use and flexibility.

### **2. Downloading and Setting Up VSCode**

### **Step 1: Download Visual Studio Code**

1. Click on the **"Download"** button. The website will detect your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### **Step 2: Install VSCode**

1. Locate the downloaded file:
    - On Windows: `.exe` file.
    - On macOS: `.dmg` file.
    - On Linux: `.deb` or `.rpm` file.
2. Follow the installation prompts:
    - Accept the license agreement.
    - Choose an installation folder (default recommended).
    - Select additional tasks like creating a desktop shortcut.

### **Step 3: Launch VSCode**

- Once installed, open VSCode.
- Youâ€™ll see the welcome screen with options to customize settings or open a file.

### **3. Basic Features of VSCode**

### **1. Interface Overview**

- **Explorer Panel:** On the left, displays open files and folders.
- **Editor Area:** Main space where you write code.
- **Activity Bar:** Provides shortcuts for file explorer, search, source control, and extensions.
- **Terminal:** Built-in terminal for running commands.

### **2. Creating a New File**

1. Click on **File > New File** or press `Ctrl+N` (`Cmd+N` on macOS).
2. Write a simple line of code (e.g., `print("Hello, VSCode!")`).
3. Save the file (`Ctrl+S`) with an appropriate extension (e.g., `.py` for Python).

### **3. Installing Extensions**

1. Go to the **Extensions View** (square icon in the Activity Bar).
2. Search for extensions like:
    - Python (for Python support).
    - Prettier (for code formatting).
    - Live Server (for real-time preview of HTML).
3. Click **Install** on the desired extension.

### **4. Using the Terminal**

1. Open the built-in terminal using `Ctrl+``.
2. Run commands directly (e.g., `python filename.py` for Python files).

### **5. Debugging Code**

1. Click on the **Run and Debug** icon in the Activity Bar.
2. Select a debugging configuration (e.g., Python).
3. Use breakpoints to pause and inspect code execution.

### **4. Hands-On Exercise: Write and Run Your First Python Script**

### **Task:**

1. Create a folder named `vscode_lab` on your desktop.
2. Open the folder in VSCode:
    - Click **File > Open Folder** and select `vscode_lab`.
3. Create a new file inside this folder named `hello_world.py`.
4. Write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

1. Save the file.
2. Open the terminal and run the script:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

1. Verify the output in the terminal.
