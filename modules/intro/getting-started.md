### **1. Engage with the System**

- **Self-Discovery**: This system is about diving deeper. I’ll give you the tools and project framework, but it's up to you to research, experiment, and discover additional ways to solve problems.
- **Ask Why and How**: When you complete tasks, don’t just follow steps. Question why each step is necessary and how you could approach it differently.

### **2. Embrace Hands-On Projects**

- **Learning by Doing**: DevOps is hands-on. The projects I assign are designed to make you apply concepts practically. The best way to learn is to tackle these projects as if they were real-world scenarios.
- **Document Your Process**: Keep notes on your challenges, solutions, and what you learned. This will help you retain knowledge and troubleshoot similar issues in the future.

### **3. Explore and Learn Independently**

- **Go Beyond the Course Material**: DevOps is an evolving field. Get comfortable researching new tools, reading documentation, and exploring forums to find answers.
- **Apply Concepts in New Contexts**: Practice setting up a system or solving a problem that’s slightly different from the projects. This will strengthen your understanding and adaptability.

### **4. Participate and Collaborate**

- **Ask Questions**: Your questions can spark great discussions and lead to deeper insights for everyone.
- **Share Your Insights**: Whether you find an interesting tool or learn a new shortcut, sharing will enrich the learning experience for the entire class.

### **5. Keep Up a Growth Mindset**

- **Embrace Challenges**: Learning DevOps means facing challenges and solving new problems independently. Stay curious, patient, and persistent.
- **Reflect and Review**: After each project or lesson, take a moment to review what you’ve learned, what you found challenging, and what you’d do differently next time.

### **What Was Before DevOps?**

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d9f99b4-0243-4f6a-ad70-ee35c09a9f83/a5842f0f-6d5e-45f4-be52-385460dda32f/image.png)

- **Traditional Model: Development and Operations Silos**
    - **Separate Teams**: Developers and operations teams worked in isolation with little communication.
    - **Hand-Off Approach**: Developers built the application, then “handed it off” to operations to deploy and manage it.
- **Waterfall Methodology**:
    - **Sequential Phases**: Development followed a linear process with fixed phases—requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment.
    - **Slow Release Cycles**: New features and bug fixes were released in large batches, often taking months (or even years) to go live.
- **Challenges with This Approach**:
    - **Long Development Times**: The lack of feedback loops and slow hand-offs delayed product improvements.
    - **High Failure Rates**: Changes introduced in large releases often led to failures, making it hard to pinpoint and fix issues.
    - **Reactive Problem-Solving**: Issues were usually addressed after deployment, making troubleshooting and resolution slow.
    - **Limited Flexibility**: Developers and operations had fixed roles and responsibilities, limiting collaboration and responsiveness.
- **“Throw it over the wall” Mentality**:
    - Developers would pass completed code to operations without fully understanding the deployment environment, leading to production issues.
    - Operations teams were left to manage and maintain code they hadn’t built, often under high pressure to keep things running smoothly.
